	abstract = {Condensates of spin-1 sodium display rich spin dynamics due to the antiferromagnetic nature of the interactions in this system. We use Faraday rotation spectroscopy to make a continuous and minimally destructive measurement of the dynamics over multiple spin oscillations on a single evolving condensate. This method provides a sharp signature to locate a magnetically tuned separatrix in phase space which depends on the net magnetization. We also observe a phase transition from a two- to a three-component condensate at a low but finite temperature using a Stern-Gerlach imaging technique. This transition should be preserved as a zero-temperature quantum phase transition.},

	abstract = {A weak continuous quantum measurement of an atomic spin ensemble can be implemented via Faraday rotation of an off-resonance probe beam, and may be used to create and probe nonclassical spin states and dynamics. We show that the probe light shift leads to nonlinearity in the spin dynamics and limits the useful Faraday measurement window. Removing the nonlinearity allows a nonperturbing measurement on the much longer time scale set by decoherence. The nonlinear spin Hamiltonian is of interest for studies of quantum chaos and real-time quantum state estimation.},

	abstract = {Spinor Bose gases form a family of quantum fluids manifesting both magnetic order and superfluidity. This article reviews experimental and theoretical progress in understanding the static and dynamic properties of these fluids. The connection between system properties and the rotational symmetry properties of the atomic states and their interactions are investigated. Following a review of the experimental techniques used for characterizing spinor gases, their mean-field and many-body ground states, both in isolation and under the application of symmetry-breaking external fields, are discussed. These states serve as the starting point for understanding low-energy dynamics, spin textures, and topological defects, effects of magnetic-dipole interactions, and various nonequilibrium collective spin-mixing phenomena. The paper aims to form connections and establish coherence among the vast range of works on spinor Bose gases, so as to point to open questions and future research opportunities.},

The VLS manifests as a {\textquotedblleft}fictitious{\textquotedblright} magnetic field, which we perceive as a change in the Larmor frequency of two spinor condensates exposed to different intensities of elliptically polarized light. We use our measurement scheme to diagnose the light-induced magnetic field and suppress it to 2.1(8){\texttimes}10-4 of its maximum value by making the trapping light linearly polarized with a quarter-wave plate in each beam. Our sensitive measurement of the VLS-induced field demonstrates high-precision, in vacuo interferometric polarimetry of dipole-trapping light and can be adapted to measure vector shifts from other lasers, advancing the application of optically trapped atoms to precision metrology.},

	abstract = {We have realized a magnetic tensor gradiometer by interferometrically measuring the relative phase between two spatially separated Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We perform simultaneous Ramsey interferometry of the proximate 87Rb spin-1 condensates in free fall and infer their relative Larmor phase, and thus the differential magnetic-field strength, with a common-mode phase noise suppression exceeding 50dB. By appropriately biasing the magnetic field and separating the BECs along orthogonal directions, we measure in vacuo the magnetic-field-gradient tensor of ambient and applied magnetic fields with a nominal precision of 0.30nTmm-1 and a sensor volume of 2{\texttimes}10-5mm3. We predict a spin-projection noise-limited magnetic energy resolution of order \~{}10? for typical Zeeman coherence times of trapped condensates with this scheme, even with the low measurement duty cycle of current BEC experiments.},
