Key thermooptic constants for TGG crystals and FK51 glass were measured. We find that the contribution of the photoelastic effect to the total thermal lens cannot be neglected for either TGG or FK51. We define a figure of merit for compensating glass and show that for FK51, an ordinary negative lens with an optimal focus is more efficient, but requires physical repositioning of the lens for different laser powers. In contrast, the use of FK51 as a compensating element is passive and works at any laser power, but is less effective than simple telescopic compensation. The efficiency of adaptive compensation can be considerably enhanced by using a compensating glass with figure of merit more than 50, a crystal with natural birefringence or gel.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present experimental evidence of a third-order nonlinear optical process, self-induced spin-to-orbital conversion (SISTOC) of the photon angular momentum. This effect is the physical mechanism at the origin of the depolarization of very intense laser beams propagating in isotropic materials. The SISTOC process, like self-focusing, is triggered by laser heating leading to a radial temperature gradient in the medium. In this work we tested the occurrence of SISTOC in a terbium-gallium-garnet rod for an impinging laser power of about 100 W. To study the SISTOC process we used different techniques: polarization analysis, interferometry, and tomography of the photon orbital angular momentum. Our results confirm, in particular, that the apparent depolarization of the beam is due to the occurrence of maximal entanglement between the spin and orbital angular momentum of the photons undergoing the SISTOC process. This explanation of the true nature of the depolarization mechanism could be of some help in finding novel methods to reduce or to compensate for this usually unwanted depolarization effect in all cases where very high laser power and good beam quality are required.},

Single integral expressions are derived for stresses and strains, which are analytically evaluated on axis at the surface and far from the laser‐heated region (for a laser spot size≫absorption depth), and numerically evaluated for the example of laser heating of a silicon substrate. This analysis is extended to the case of laser heating of thin films on substrates. Use of these stress and strain profiles suggests that dislocations may form at the surface during high‐temperature laser processing of silicon at scan speeds typically used in direct laser writing. Also the elastic strains induced during laser heating shift phonon frequencies from their thermal equilibrium values, thereby complicating the use of Raman scattering as an optical probe of temperature. This is shown to be particularly significant for laser heating of silicon thin films on fused silica substrates and not very important for laser processing of silicon substrates or silicon thin films on sapphire.},

	abstract = {In the context of the Large Hadron Collider, high energy particles are dumped onto blocks of material that are commonly called beam-dumps. The high energy deposition is almost instantaneous and can be represented by a very high power source for a short period of time. Temperatures can rise above failure limits at the locations of highest energy deposition. Particle beam accelerators are also widely used for medical applications where electron, proton or ion particle beams at energies of the order of megaelectronvolts are used to destroy cancer cells [1]. The motivation of this article is to be able to calculate the temperature fields without turning to numerical simulations that can be very time consuming. We present closed form solutions of the transient heat diffusion problem during the energy deposition. The transient heat diffusion equation assumes infinitely fast propagation of the information throughout the medium, but the diffusion process remains at finite speeds. Energy is deposited in such a small time interval so that the heat flux across the boundaries is assumed to be zero. It follows that the heat diffusion equation can be solved in an infinite medium, by the use of Green’s functions, to provide closed form solutions for the transient temperature field within the pulse time. The range of applicability of these solutions is supported by a parametric relative error analysis. They demand very little computational power and time compared to commercial numerical software.},

	abstract = {A method is developed for calculating the effects of a strong oscillating field on two states of a quantum-mechanical system which are connected by a matrix element of the field. Explicit approximate solutions are obtained for a variety of special cases, and the results of numerical computations are given for others. The effect of an rf field on the J=2→1 l-type doublet microwave absorption lines of OCS has been studied in particular both experimentally and theoretically. Each line was observed to split into two components when the frequency of the rf field was near 12.78 Mc or 38.28 Mc, which are the frequencies separating the J=1 and J=2 pairs of levels, respectively. By measuring the rf frequency, ν0, at which the microwave lines are split into two equally intense components, one may determine the separation between the energy levels. The measured value of ν0 depends upon the intensity of the rf field and the form of this dependence has been calculated and found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.},

The frequency lock point generated from synthesized error signals using either \${\textbackslash}pi/4\$ or \$3{\textbackslash}pi/4\$ laser phase-steps during the intermediate pulse is tightly protected against large laser pulse area variations and errors in potentially applied frequency shift compensations.

The light shifts of atomic levels from the trapping potential in these systems can result in detrimental effects such as fluctuating dipole force heating, inhomogeneous detunings, and inhibition of laser cooling, which limits the atomic species that can be manipulated. In particular, these light shifts can be large enough to prevent loading into optical tweezers directly from a magneto-optical trap. We present a general solution to these limitations by loading, cooling, and imaging single atoms with temporally alternating beams. Because this technique does not depend on any specific spectral properties, we expect it to enable the optical tweezer method to control nearly any atomic or molecular species that can be laser cooled and optically trapped. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the role of heating and required cooling for single atom tweezer loading.},

The wavelength lies between the D1 and D2 spectral lines at 790.03235(3) nm. The measurement is sensitive to the tensor contribution to the polarizability, which has been removed so that the reported value is the zero of the scalar polarizability.

For example, neutral-atom optical-lattice architectures provide environmental isolation through the use of states that are robust against fluctuating external fields, yet external fields are essential for qubit addressing. Here, we demonstrate the selection of individual qubits with external fields, while the qubits are in field-insensitive superpositions. We use a spatially inhomogeneous external field to map selected qubits to a different field-insensitive superposition, minimally perturbing unselected qubits, despite the fact that the addressing field is not spatially localized. We show robust single-qubit rotations on neutral-atom qubits located at selected lattice sites. This precise coherent control should be more generally applicable to state transfer and qubit isolation in other architectures using field-insensitive qubits.},

	abstract = {The theory of a method to measure electric-dipole polarizabilities is presented. The method uses two-stage laser ablation to produce a pulsed beam of atoms from a solid target. A pair of slits makes the velocity distribution of the atomic beam nonuniform in a way that is well characterized. The light-force technique uses the polarization forces experienced by an atom in the intense, inhomogeneous electromagnetic field of a standing-wave laser to change the velocity distribution of the atomic beam. The large forces cause measurable Doppler shifts in the resonant frequency of the atoms. These frequency shifts change the amount of absorption of resonant light, yielding information about the change in the velocity distribution of the atoms. The detailed shape of the final absorption distribution is polarizability dependent. In the classical picture of the light force, the standing-wave electric field induces a time-varying dipole moment in each atom. Each atom then experiences a Lorentz force due to coherent interaction of the oscillating dipole moment with the time-varying magnetic field. The quantum-mechanical picture corresponds to the Kapitza-Dirac effect for atoms: an atom absorbs a photon from one of the two beams which form the standing wave, and is then stimulated to emit this photon by the other, counterpropagating beam. This paper provides a classical treatment of the light force experienced by an atom in a standing-wave light field; the polarizability is treated quantum mechanically. The theory presented here can be applied to atoms with a scalar polarizability, such as rubidium, and to atoms with significant tensor components, such as uranium. Experimental results from application of the light-force technique to a measurement of the polarizability of rubidium are also presented.},

Similar magic-wavelength techniques are not possible for the microwave hyperfine transitions in the alkali metals due to their simple electronic structure.

However, the charge neutrality of these systems presents an apparent limitation—a wide range of intriguing phenomena arise from the Lorentz force for charged particles in a magnetic field, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron systems. The limitation can be circumvented by exploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to create synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was demonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments on rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a magnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum rotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the difficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches are not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics. Here we experimentally realize an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold neutral atoms, which is evident from the appearance of vortices in our Bose–Einstein condensate. Our approach uses a spatially dependent optical coupling between internal states of the atoms, yielding a Berry's phase sufficient to create large synthetic magnetic fields, and is not subject to the limitations of rotating systems. With a suitable lattice configuration, it should be possible to reach the quantum Hall regime, potentially enabling studies of topological quantum computation.},

	abstract = {Spin–orbit (SO) coupling—the interaction between a quantum particle’s spin and its momentum—is ubiquitous in physical systems. In condensed matter systems, SO coupling is crucial for the spin-Hall effect and topological insulators; it contributes to the electronic properties of materials such as GaAs, and is important for spintronic devices. Quantum many-body systems of ultracold atoms can be precisely controlled experimentally, and would therefore seem to provide an ideal platform on which to study SO coupling. Although an atom’s intrinsic SO coupling affects its electronic structure, it does not lead to coupling between the spin and the centre-of-mass motion of the atom. Here, we engineer SO coupling (with equal Rashba and Dresselhaus strengths) in a neutral atomic Bose–Einstein condensate by dressing two atomic spin states with a pair of lasers. Such coupling has not been realized previously for ultracold atomic gases, or indeed any bosonic system. Furthermore, in the presence of the laser coupling, the interactions between the two dressed atomic spin states are modified, driving a quantum phase transition from a spatially spin-mixed state (lasers off) to a phase-separated state (above a critical laser intensity). We develop a many-body theory that provides quantitative agreement with the observed location of the transition. The engineered SO coupling—equally applicable for bosons and fermions—sets the stage for the realization of topological insulators in fermionic neutral atom systems.},

	abstract = {The theory of a method to measure electric-dipole polarizabilities is presented. The method uses two-stage laser ablation to produce a pulsed beam of atoms from a solid target. A pair of slits makes the velocity distribution of the atomic beam nonuniform in a way that is well characterized. The light-force technique uses the polarization forces experienced by an atom in the intense, inhomogeneous electromagnetic field of a standing-wave laser to change the velocity distribution of the atomic beam. The large forces cause measurable Doppler shifts in the resonant frequency of the atoms. These frequency shifts change the amount of absorption of resonant light, yielding information about the change in the velocity distribution of the atoms. The detailed shape of the final absorption distribution is polarizability dependent. In the classical picture of the light force, the standing-wave electric field induces a time-varying dipole moment in each atom. Each atom then experiences a Lorentz force due to coherent interaction of the oscillating dipole moment with the time-varying magnetic field. The quantum-mechanical picture corresponds to the Kapitza-Dirac effect for atoms: an atom absorbs a photon from one of the two beams which form the standing wave, and is then stimulated to emit this photon by the other, counterpropagating beam. This paper provides a classical treatment of the light force experienced by an atom in a standing-wave light field; the polarizability is treated quantum mechanically. The theory presented here can be applied to atoms with a scalar polarizability, such as rubidium, and to atoms with significant tensor components, such as uranium. Experimental results from application of the light-force technique to a measurement of the polarizability of rubidium are also presented.},

Here, we report the observation of coherent spin-changing collisions in a gas of spin-1 bosons. Starting with condensates occupying two spin states, a condensate in the third spin state is coherently and reversibly created by atomic collisions. The observed dynamics are analogous to Josephson oscillations in weakly connected superconductors and represent a type of matter–wave four-wave mixing. The spin-dependent scattering length is determined from these oscillations to be -1.45(32) bohr.

	abstract = {This chapter discusses optical dipole traps for neutral atoms. Methods for storage and trapping of charged and neutral particles have very often served as the experimental key to great scientific advances, covering physics in the vast energy range from elementary particles to ultracold atomic quantum matter. It describes the basic physics of dipole trapping in fardetuned light, the typical experimental techniques and procedures, and the different trap types currently available, along with their specific features. In the experiments discussed, optical dipole traps have already shown great promise for a variety of different applications. Of particular importance is the trapping of atoms in the absolute internal ground state, which cannot be trapped magnetically. In this state, inelastic binary collisions are completely suppressed for energetic reasons. In this respect, an ultracold cesium gas represents a particularly interesting situation, because Bose–Einstein condensation seems attainable only for the absolute ground state. Therefore, an optical trap may be the only way to realize a quantum-degenerate gas of Cs atoms. Further, optical dipole traps can be seen as storage devices at the low end of the presently explorable energy scale. Future experiments exploiting the particular advantages of these traps can reveal interesting new phenomena.},

The interference pattern of a set of intersecting laser beams can create a stable periodic potential for neutral atoms through the ac Stark shift (light shift), which can trap, and thereby organize atoms in an ordered, crystal-like structure. Historically, interest in these “optical lattices” grew out of the study of laser cooling. The chapter introduces this subject by discussing the key one-dimensional model system for laser cooling and trapping in optical lattices. It discusses the crystallography of various lattice geometries and details the basic laser cooling theory in optical lattices. The chapter reviews experimental work that probes optical lattices through spectroscopy and discusses new developments made in the field, along with possible future directions. Aside from its role as a model system for laser cooling, the motion of atoms in an optical lattice is closely analogous to that of an electron in a solid-state crystal. This situation offers unique opportunities to explore phenomena that were previously accessible only in condensed matter.},

But the recorded bulk magnetic field itself provides only limited spatial or structural information about the sample. Most NMR applications rely therefore on more elaborate techniques such as magnetic field gradient encoding or spin correlation spectroscopy, which enable spatially resolved imaging and molecular structure analysis, respectively. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different and intrinsically information-richer modality of detecting NMR, based on the rotation of the polarization of a laser beam by the nuclear spins in a liquid sample. Optical NMR detection has in fact a long history in atomic vapours with narrow resonance lines, but has so far only been applied to highly specialized condensed matter systems such as quantum dots. It has been predicted that laser illumination can shift NMR frequencies and thus aid detection, but the effect is very small and has never been observed. In contrast, our measurements on water and liquid 129Xe show that the complementary effect—the rotation of light polarization by nuclear spins—is readily measurable, and that it is enhanced dramatically in samples containing heavy nuclei. This approach to optical NMR detection should allow correlated optical and NMR spectroscopy on complex molecules, and continuous two-dimensional imaging of nuclear magnetization with spatial resolution limited only by light diffraction.},

We use the vector polarizability of an alkali-metal atom to produce a polarization-dependent ac-Stark shift that resembles a Zeeman shift. We study a transition from the {\textbar}2S1/2,F=2,mF=−2⟩ to the {\textbar}2S1/2,F=1,mF=−1⟩ state of Li7 to observe 0.59±0.02 Hz linewidth with interrogation time of 2 s and 0.82±0.06 s coherence time of a superposition state. Implications of the narrow linewidth and the long coherence time for precision spectroscopy and quantum information processing using atoms in an optical lattice are discussed.},

Stress-induced birefringence can cause an ellipticity in the polarization of an initially linearly polarized laser beam. The amount of ellipticity can be reconstructed by measuring the differential vector light shift of an atomic hyperfine transition. Measuring the ellipticity as a function of the linear polarization angle allows us to infer the amount of birefringence Δn at the level of 10−8 and identify the orientation of the optical axes. The key benefit of this method is the ability to separately characterize each vacuum window, allowing the birefringence to be precisely compensated in existing vacuum apparatuses.},

We show that our measurements are in full agreement with the second-order perturbation-theory treatment of light-induced energy-level shifts, when the effects of inhomogeneities are properly taken into consideration. The effects of inhomogeneous broadening must be carefully considered when extracting oscillator strengths from light-shift data, or when performing high-precision laser spectroscopy.},

In conjunction with existing theoretical and experimental data, we find 0.3235(9)ea0 and 0.5230(8)ea0 for the 5s−6p1/2 and 5s−6p3/2 elements, respectively, an order of magnitude more accurate than the best theoretical values.

We then transfer the resulting cold dense cloud into a spatially mode-matched optical dipole trap by lowering the quadrupole field gradient to below gravity. This technique combines the efficient capture of atoms from a MOT into a magnetic trap with the rapid evaporation of optical dipole traps; the approach is insensitive to the peak quadrupole gradient and the precise trapping beam waist.

Currently, practitioners must choose between algebraic methods that guarantee an ellipse fit but exhibit high bias, and geometric methods that are less biased but may no longer guarantee an ellipse solution. We address this limitation by proposing a method that strikes a balance between these two objectives. Specifically, we propose a fast stable algorithm for fitting a guaranteed ellipse to data using the Sampson distance as a data-parameter discrepancy measure. We validate the stability, accuracy, and efficiency of our method on both real and synthetic data. Experimental results show that our algorithm is a fast and accurate approximation of the computationally more expensive orthogonal-distance-based ellipse fitting method. In view of these qualities, our method may be of interest to practitioners who require accurate and guaranteed ellipse estimates.},
