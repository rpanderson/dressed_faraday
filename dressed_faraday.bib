	abstract = {We have realized a magnetic tensor gradiometer by interferometrically measuring the relative phase between two spatially separated Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We perform simultaneous Ramsey interferometry of the proximate 87Rb spin-1 condensates in free fall and infer their relative Larmor phase, and thus the differential magnetic-field strength, with a common-mode phase noise suppression exceeding 50dB. By appropriately biasing the magnetic field and separating the BECs along orthogonal directions, we measure in vacuo the magnetic-field-gradient tensor of ambient and applied magnetic fields with a nominal precision of 0.30nTmm−1 and a sensor volume of 2×10−5mm3. We predict a spin-projection noise-limited magnetic energy resolution of order ∼10ℏ for typical Zeeman coherence times of trapped condensates with this scheme, even with the low measurement duty cycle of current BEC experiments.},

	abstract = {We use differential Ramsey interferometry of ultracold atoms to characterize the vector light shift (VLS) from a far-off-resonance optical dipole trap at λ=1064 nm. The VLS manifests as a “fictitious” magnetic field, which we perceive as a change in the Larmor frequency of two spinor condensates exposed to different intensities of elliptically polarized light. We use our measurement scheme to diagnose the light-induced magnetic field and suppress it to 2.1(8)×10−4 of its maximum value by making the trapping light linearly polarized with a quarter-wave plate in each beam. Our sensitive measurement of the VLS-induced field demonstrates high-precision, in vacuo interferometric polarimetry of dipole-trapping light and can be adapted to measure vector shifts from other lasers, advancing the application of optically trapped atoms to precision metrology.},
