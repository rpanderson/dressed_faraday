A simple theory is developed to predict the measurement sensitivity and associated cost in terms of decoherence caused by the scattering of probe photons. Calculated signal-to-noise ratios in measurements of Larmor precession are found to agree with experimental data for a wide range of lattice intensity and detuning. Finally, quantum back-action is estimated by comparing the measurement sensitivity to spin projection noise, and shown to be insignificant in the current experiment.

The timescale of this /`instantaneous/' process can be stretched using weak measurements, such that it takes the form of a gradual random walk towards a final state. Remarkably, the interim measurement record is sufficient to continuously track and steer the quantum state using feedback. Here we implement quantum feedback control in a solid-state system, namely a superconducting quantum bit (qubit) coupled to a microwave cavity. A weak measurement of the qubit is implemented by probing the cavity with microwave photons, maintaining its average occupation at less than one photon. These photons are then directed to a high-bandwidth, quantum-noise-limited amplifier, which allows real-time monitoring of the state of the cavity (and, hence, that of the qubit) with high fidelity. We demonstrate quantum feedback control by inhibiting the decay of Rabi oscillations, allowing them to persist indefinitely. Such an ability permits the active suppression of decoherence and enables a method of quantum error correction based on weak continuous measurements. Other applications include quantum state stabilization, entanglement generation using measurement, state purification and adaptive measurements.},

To achieve their potential, the qubits need, however, to be shielded from the deleterious effects of the environment. While dynamical decoupling techniques can improve the coherence time, they impose a compromise between sensitivity and the frequency range of the field to be measured. Moreover, the performance of pulse sequences is ultimately limited by control bounds and errors. Here we analyze a versatile alternative based on continuous driving. We find that continuous dynamical decoupling schemes can be used for ac magnetometry, providing similar frequency constraints on the ac field and improved sensitivity for some noise regimes. In addition, the flexibility of phase and amplitude modulation could yield superior robustness to driving errors and a better adaptability to external experimental scenarios.},

We address this challenge by introducing the concept of concatenated continuous dynamical decoupling, which can overcome not only external magnetic noise but also noise due to fluctuations in driving fields. We show theoretically that this approach can achieve relaxation limited coherence times, and demonstrate experimentally that already the most basic implementation of this concept yields an order of magnitude improvement to the decoherence time for the electron spin of nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. The proposed scheme can be applied to a wide variety of other physical systems, including trapped atoms and ions and quantum dots, and may be combined with other quantum technologies challenges such as quantum sensing and quantum information processing.},

	abstract = {In order to test the validity of various techniques and formalisms developed for treating many-particle systems, a model is constructed which is simple enough to be solved exactly in some cases, but yet is non-trivial. The construction of such models is based on the observation that bilinear products of creation and annihilation operators can be considered as generators of Lie groups. Thus the problem of finding eigenvalues can be greatly simplified by the additional integrals of the motion which are present if the Hamiltonian is constructed so as to commute with invariants of the group. In the present case, the model consists of N fermions distributed in two N-fold degenerate levels and interacting via a monopole-monopole force. It is shown that the model Hamiltonian is easily expressed in terms of quasi-spin operators and exact eigenvalues are obtained. In addition, eigenvalues are calculated with ordinary perturbation theory using values for the number of particles and interaction strength which are appropriate to the more realistic problems of finite nuclei. In subsequent papers we consider the results obtained by various other approximation methods for comparison with the exact results presented here.},

The quantum wave properties of particles are exploited in metrology using atom interferometers, allowing for high-precision inertia measurements. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art time standard is based on an interferometric technique known as Ramsey spectroscopy. However, the precision of an interferometer is limited by classical statistics owing to the finite number of atoms used to deduce the quantity of interest. Here we show experimentally that the classical precision limit can be surpassed using nonlinear atom interferometry with a Bose–Einstein condensate. Controlled interactions between the atoms lead to non-classical entangled states within the interferometer; this represents an alternative approach to the use of non-classical input states. Extending quantum interferometry to the regime of large atom number, we find that phase sensitivity is enhanced by 15 per cent relative to that in an ideal classical measurement. Our nonlinear atomic beam splitter follows the ‘one-axis-twisting’ scheme and implements interaction control using a narrow Feshbach resonance. We perform noise tomography of the quantum state within the interferometer and detect coherent spin squeezing with a squeezing factor of -8.2 dB (refs 11–15). The results provide information on the many-particle quantum state, and imply the entanglement of 170 atoms.},

They have been used in diverse experiments involving low-dimensional quantum gases, cavity quantum electrodynamics, atom–surface interactions, and chip-based atomic clocks and interferometers. However, a severe limitation of atom chips is that techniques to control atomic interactions and to generate entanglement have not been experimentally available so far. Such techniques enable chip-based studies of entangled many-body systems and are a key prerequisite for atom chip applications in quantum simulations, quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Here we report the experimental generation of multi-particle entanglement on an atom chip by controlling elastic collisional interactions with a state-dependent potential. We use this technique to generate spin-squeezed states of a two-component Bose–Einstein condensate; such states are a useful resource for quantum metrology. The observed reduction in spin noise of -3.7 ± 0.4 dB, combined with the spin coherence, implies four-partite entanglement between the condensate atoms; this could be used to improve an interferometric measurement by -2.5 ± 0.6 dB over the standard quantum limit. Our data show good agreement with a dynamical multi-mode simulation and allow us to reconstruct the Wigner function of the spin-squeezed condensate. The techniques reported here could be directly applied to chip-based atomic clocks, currently under development.},

	abstract = {Condensates of spin-1 sodium display rich spin dynamics due to the antiferromagnetic nature of the interactions in this system. We use Faraday rotation spectroscopy to make a continuous and minimally destructive measurement of the dynamics over multiple spin oscillations on a single evolving condensate. This method provides a sharp signature to locate a magnetically tuned separatrix in phase space which depends on the net magnetization. We also observe a phase transition from a two- to a three-component condensate at a low but finite temperature using a Stern-Gerlach imaging technique. This transition should be preserved as a zero-temperature quantum phase transition.},

	abstract = {A weak continuous quantum measurement of an atomic spin ensemble can be implemented via Faraday rotation of an off-resonance probe beam, and may be used to create and probe nonclassical spin states and dynamics. We show that the probe light shift leads to nonlinearity in the spin dynamics and limits the useful Faraday measurement window. Removing the nonlinearity allows a nonperturbing measurement on the much longer time scale set by decoherence. The nonlinear spin Hamiltonian is of interest for studies of quantum chaos and real-time quantum state estimation.},

This article reviews experimental and theoretical progress in understanding the static and dynamic properties of these fluids. The connection between system properties and the rotational symmetry properties of the atomic states and their interactions are investigated. Following a review of the experimental techniques used for characterizing spinor gases, their mean-field and many-body ground states, both in isolation and under the application of symmetry-breaking external fields, are discussed. These states serve as the starting point for understanding low-energy dynamics, spin textures, and topological defects, effects of magnetic-dipole interactions, and various nonequilibrium collective spin-mixing phenomena. The paper aims to form connections and establish coherence among the vast range of works on spinor Bose gases, so as to point to open questions and future research opportunities.},

The VLS manifests as a “fictitious” magnetic field, which we perceive as a change in the Larmor frequency of two spinor condensates exposed to different intensities of elliptically polarized light. We use our measurement scheme to diagnose the light-induced magnetic field and suppress it to 2.1(8)×10−4 of its maximum value by making the trapping light linearly polarized with a quarter-wave plate in each beam. Our sensitive measurement of the VLS-induced field demonstrates high-precision, in vacuo interferometric polarimetry of dipole-trapping light and can be adapted to measure vector shifts from other lasers, advancing the application of optically trapped atoms to precision metrology.},

We perform simultaneous Ramsey interferometry of the proximate 87Rb spin-1 condensates in free fall and infer their relative Larmor phase, and thus the differential magnetic-field strength, with a common-mode phase noise suppression exceeding 50dB. By appropriately biasing the magnetic field and separating the BECs along orthogonal directions, we measure in vacuo the magnetic-field-gradient tensor of ambient and applied magnetic fields with a nominal precision of 0.30nTmm−1 and a sensor volume of 2×10−5mm3. We predict a spin-projection noise-limited magnetic energy resolution of order ∼10ℏ for typical Zeeman coherence times of trapped condensates with this scheme, even with the low measurement duty cycle of current BEC experiments.},
