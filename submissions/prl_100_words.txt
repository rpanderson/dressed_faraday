Atomic spins make sensitive magnetometers. Driving transitions between spin states creates new 'continuous dynamical decoupled' states, sensitive to oscillating fields yet protected from low-frequency drifts. We continuously observe an ultracold spin-1 gas undergoing such decoupling, measuring the populations, splittings and couplings of the new states in real time. We show that one state-pair is protected to higher order, being ~20 times better protected than standard decoupled states and ~100 times better than undecoupled states. Combining continuous measurement with continuous decoupling will enable feedback and tracking capabilities for noise-robust atomic magnetometry.
