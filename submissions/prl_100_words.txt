Driving transitions between spin states creates new 'continuous dynamical decoupled' states, sensitive to oscillating fields yet protected from low-frequency drifts and inhomogeneities. We continuously observe an ultracold spin-1 gas undergoing such decoupling, measuring the populations, splittings, and couplings of the new states in real time. This characterization is completed during a single experimental preparation, rather than the hundreds required with projective measurement. We show that one state-pair is protected to fourth-order with respect to field instabilities, higher than the quadratic suppression of standard decoupling. Combining continuous measurement with continuous decoupling will enable feedback and tracking capabilities for noise-robust atomic magnetometry.
