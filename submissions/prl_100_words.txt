Driving transitions between spin states creates new 'continuous dynamical decoupled' states, sensitive to oscillating fields yet protected from low-frequency drifts and inhomogeneities. We continuously observe an ultracold spin-1 gas undergoing such decoupling, measuring the populations, splittings and couplings of the new states in real time. This characterization is complete in a single twenty-second experimental preparation, rather than the hundreds of preparations required with projective measurement. We show that one state-pair is protected to higher order, with normalised decoupling 75 times lower than standard decoupling. Combining continuous measurement with continuous decoupling will enable feedback and tracking capabilities for noise-robust atomic magnetometry.
