Strongly driving transitions between spin states might be expected to scramble their magnetic sensitivity. In fact, new 'continuous dynamical decoupled' states are created, sensitive to oscillating fields yet protected from low-frequency drifts and inhomogeneities. We continuously observe an ultracold spin-1 gas undergoing such decoupling, measuring the populations, splittings and couplings of the new states in real time. We show that one state-pair is protected to higher order, being ~20 times better protected than standard decoupled states and ~100 times better than undecoupled states. Combining continuous measurement with continuous decoupling will enable feedback and tracking capabilities for noise-robust atomic magnetometry.
