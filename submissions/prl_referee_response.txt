Referee couldn't see utility of (a) fourth order decoupling for magnetometry, (b) continuous measurement.

Whacks of single atom:
(a) 14 MHz is not ac, it's rf! Not bio-interesting. Why can't they go lower?
(b) Technique is great, but not generally applicable. Requires four level spin-0 + spin-1 system.

Point to benefits of continuous measurement:
* Continuous measuremnt shows you what the amplitude flucctuatiions are: quadrature demodulation will lead to self-certifying, phase sensitive ac magnetometer.
* Closed-loop control and quantum feedback schemes.

"No new insights into dressed state physics"
* No experiment will reveal insights into "dressed state physics" in 2017!
* Our measurements revealed the previously unappreciated or uncommented on third coupling.
* If couplings are known, this amounts to a new form of quantum state estimation.

Referee cares only about sensing (*splittings*) and not the dressed *states* themselves.
Pointing toward the states themselves it what distinguishes us from a soley metrological advancement.

Novel topological states are a huge field and not just a cold atoms ghetto.

Having discussed with each other the review of our co-submission, and the similarity of the single reports returned by your referee.

The referee comments that while our paper does not measure an applied field. In neither case was the paper predicated on achieving a new sensitivity but decoupling is also useful for non-metrology purposes.
This referee has only viewed the paper from the perspective of metrology and commented on the broad significance from this perspective.

Fix: continuous measurement is not continuous decoupling.
