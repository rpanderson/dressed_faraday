Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript 'Continuous observation of a dynamically decoupled spin-1 spectrum' to Physical Review Letters.
In it we observe the continuous dynamical decoupling of a spin-1 quantum gas in real-time, dynamically probing its spectrum, coherences, and coupling strengths.
Dynamical decoupling a system from its environment is not only applicable to quantum information but has broad application to quantum metrology and quantum state/process tomography.
Yet few systems permit the appraisal and refinement of dynamical deocupling in real-time; even weak measurements of single qubits and NV centers require on the order of 10^4 repeated preparation and detection cycles.

We advance the time-frequency domain reduction of a weak measurement record to extract rich information about the quantum state, dressed-state coupling, and energies simultaneously.
The utility of this reduction is widely understood, most notably for visualising gravitational wave signals with spectrograms; for quantum observables, we feel that the spectrogram is a unique and potent signature of dynamically probing an eigenspectrum.

This manuscript forms a co-submission with N. Lundblad, I. B. Spielman of NIST, who recently brought to our attention the synthetic clock states, and with whom we discussed the complementary nature of our minimally perturbative atom-light interface to demonstrate the insensitivity of these states to magnetic field variations (temporal and spatial).
While these works both elucidate this protected subspace of a non-degenerate, driven spin-1 system, they do so in a complementary way; a distinguishing focus of our work is the continuous weak measurement of the states and the ability to use this to expeditiously optimize the decoupling scheme.
For example, the curvature of the synthetic clock transition is measured for several control Hamiltonians in a dozen 20 second realizations of our experiment.
Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to probe dressed-state coupling strengths without driving transitions, a form of Hamiltonian parameter estimation based on prior knowledge of the initial state.
Our work is further distinguished by the analytic results on the synthetic clock states, applicable to our implementation at lower magnetic fields where the linear and quadratic Zeeman effect are both separable and closely approximate the hyperfine interaction.

Thank you for considering our manuscript for publication.

Yours faithfully,

R. P. Anderson, M. J. Kewming, and L. D. Turner
