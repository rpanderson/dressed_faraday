Concluding statement about quantum noise
* A weak measurement gives us information about hte state, coupling, and energies all at once.
* It doesn't give us information about quantum noise (weak, photon-shot noise limit).
* With a modification of the probe (atom-shot noise dominated) we could measure and affect the quantum noise dynamically.
* Under this Hamiltonian probing the dressed state coherences we might be able to observe non-Gaussian quantum noise geometries in a manner analagous to Nature (Mitchell).

Summary of information richness
===============================
Given a known initial state, this amounts to a continuous measurement of all coupling strengths in the new basis (analagous to Hamiltonian parameter estimation / process tomography / Hamiltonian learning).
Or given the coupling strengths from an independent characterisation of the Hamiltonian is a direct measure of the dressed density matrix (analagous to QST).
This should be no surprise, as the Hamiltonian
