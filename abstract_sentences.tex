and emulating quantum magnetism in solid-state systems.

% Impact of marrying dynamical decoupling with continuous weak measurement
This highly protected transition in a microscale quantum gas gains a new magnetic sensitivity in a tunable band persisting for many milliseconds: this is the length scale, frequency, and duration relevant to biomagnetic phenomena such as neural spike trains.

% Dynamical decoupling: a broader view
Quantum states and spectra can be made sensitive to specific fields whilst simultaneously insensitive to external perturbations.

% This dynamical decoupling is the shit
The higher-order decoupling of these states from perturbations in concert with continuous measurement [may / could / will /make] [make / provide / advance / ]

% Magneto-blah-blah
This highly protected transition makes an ac magnetometer in a useful kilohertz band and delivers a continuous measurement.
