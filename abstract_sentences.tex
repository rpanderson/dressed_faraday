Quantum states and spectra can be made sensitive to specific fields whilst simultaneously insensitive to external perturbations.

The higher-order decoupling of these states from perturbations in concert with continuous measurement [may / could / will /make] [make / provide / advance / ] 

This highly protected transition makes an ac magnetometer in a useful kilohertz band and delivers a continuous measurement.

This weds the useful hallmarks of clock-state metrology and band tunable magnetometry with real-time observation, ingredients for new experiments that emulate quantum magnetism in solid-state systems.
